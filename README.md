## What is it?
* A simple, responsive, and elegant (as I will call it) repo for my personal website.
* Written only in simple HTML and CSS.

## Can I use it?
* Fork? Sure, and drop me a message! **Duplicate and name it as yours? No. **
  * I made all source code here available in public, evidencing my commitment to advocate for open data,
  * however, I deem creativity creditable and copyrighted. 
  * Feel free to refer to anything in this repo, critique, feedback – crowd wisdom can make things better! I'd love to hear your voice.
  * If you want to fork it, you may do so but I wish to see more creativity from you if you want to build something out of it.
  * Trust me, these are just really, really simple codes, but creativity is not simple.
