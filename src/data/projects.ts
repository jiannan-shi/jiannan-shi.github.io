What if the very algorithms designed to control and conform could be reimagined as tools for creativity and resistance? — I explored the ways LGBTQ+ content creators engage with algorithmic digital platforms, employing creative 'workarounds' to foster queer sociality despite censorship.

## Abstract

Popular social media platforms in China, such as Bilibili, Douyin, and Xiaohongshu (REDnote), use machine learning algorithms to curate personalized feeds and enforce content moderation. But the opacity of such algorithms introduces socially consequential and often problematic mechanisms of classification. Given the playful resistance of queer individuals against a normative social environment, the interaction between algorithms and content creators warrants close examination. This study investigates how LGBTQ+ content creators navigate these algorithm-driven platforms, focusing on their negotiation of digital normativity to share non-heterosexual content and foster queer sociality in China. Avoiding the oversimplification of viewing algorithms and those implementing them as monolithic entities, I explore how content creators creatively manage to produce and distribute their work within the constraints of these platforms, and even by playing with these constraints. I collected data from an ethnography on algorithms, interviews, and an open-source investigation into recommendation algorithms, through a scavenge approach. I argue that LGBTQ+ content creators engage with algorithms in ways that are simultaneously non-conforming and non-confrontational. They imagine algorithmic effects, appropriate outcomes, and play with the opacity of machine learning to navigate three aspects of digital normativity in China: heteronormativity, Internet civilization, and commercialization. Empirically, I identified three strategies used to create and expand queer sociality within these constraints: camouflaging, filtering, and verticalizing. Theoretically, I introduce ‘workarounds’ as a framework that transcends the binary perspectives of conformity and resistance in discussions of authoritarian governance, algorithmic control, and user-platform interaction.

Exploring symbolic and physical boundaries in Prague through stories of the Lennon Wall, urban segregation, and historical graffiti.

***Jiannan conducted research, interviews, and vox-pop for the episode “Walls,” discovering the physical and imaginary walls that divide the Czech Republic.***

> Walls form a truly significant part of our lives. They *surround* us. They *protect* us. And in many cases... they have hidden meaning beyond what meets the eye. Look around you - there’s a good chance you’re looking at one right now. In this edition of the Praguecast, we decided to explore the significance of walls - both real and imagined - in the Czech Republic.
>

> Whether it’s the growing divide between locals and tourists at the Lennon Wall, or the ethnic divide created by the infamous Maticni Street wall in the northern city of Usti, walls can signify far more than just a physical structure offering safety and protection. From walls that are highly frequented by tourists to those that are virtually forgotten, stay tuned to hear how walls convey meaning and impact life in the Czech Republic.
